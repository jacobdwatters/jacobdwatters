Hi, my name is Jacob Watters. I currently work for the DoD doing reaseach in deep reinforcment learning.

Education: 
 - MS Computer Science: Colorado School of Mines
   - Thesis: Recall Informed Self-Attention Representation Learning and Generative AI For Improved Car Accident Detection in Highly Unbalanced Datasets (what a mouthfull)
 - BS Applied Mathematics and Computer Science: Metropolitan State University of Denver

I spend most of my free time programming or doing math. However, when I am not doing those things I enjoy painting, drawing, and playing the piano.
