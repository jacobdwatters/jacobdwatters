Hi, my name is Jacob Watters. I am currently a senior at MSU Denver studying applied mathematics and computer science (CS). 
I am a math and CS tutor at MSU Denver. I'm also a learning assistant for the CS and Math department where I supplement instructor teaching in machine learning, 
digital image processing, and computer organization. My main research interests are machine learning and numerical linear algebra.

I spend most of my free time programming or doing math. However, when I am not doing those things I enjoy painting, drawing, and playing the piano.
