Hi, my name is Jacob Watters. I am currently pursuing a MS in computer sciene with a focus in machine learning from the Colorado School of Mines. I have a BS in applied mathematics and computer science from the Metropolitan State University of Denver.

I work as a research assistant in the mining engineering department at the Colorado School of Mines where I build machine learning models to tackle pratical problems within the world of mining saftey.

I spend most of my free time programming or doing math. However, when I am not doing those things I enjoy painting, drawing, and playing the piano.
